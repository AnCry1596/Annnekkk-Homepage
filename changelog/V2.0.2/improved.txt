Reduce proxied requests size by removing unnecessary headers and compressing payloads. This optimization leads to faster response times and reduced bandwidth usage, enhancing overall performance for end-users.
Reduce memory consumption by optimizing data structures and implementing efficient algorithms. This results in lower resource usage, allowing the application to run smoothly on devices with limited memory capacity.
Enhance security by updating dependencies to their latest versions and patching known vulnerabilities. This ensures that the application remains protected against emerging threats and maintains user trust.
